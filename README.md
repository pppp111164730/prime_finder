# prime_finder
The MessyPrime.py is my attempts to try and write a prime finder based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes without knowing what it was untill I wrote 9 different functions to find primes. There are 2 that use the full extent of the sieve of Eratosthenes, at the time I made it, that bring the previous O(n^2) down to O(n^1.5) sometimes know as O(n*<sup>n</sup>).
